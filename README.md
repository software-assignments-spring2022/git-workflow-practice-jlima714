# Wordle Bot :

Doing the daily wordle has been the newest trend lately and I wondered how well you could teach a computer to complete it. There are many different tactics that people employ to solve the wordle. Some people guess the same first few words each time until they have a good idea of what letters are in it and then they make their real guess, while others guess different words each time and try to make each guess based on the letters they know are in the word. I thought this article was interesting in how it walks you through each step of creating a wordle bot and all the modifications they made to reduce the number of guesses.

This was a really interesting read especially since Wordle is a game I and many others play every morning! I enjoyed reading through the thought process behind a program that completes this puzzle and it may even help me think about my process and make changes to it. Thank you for sharing this article!
